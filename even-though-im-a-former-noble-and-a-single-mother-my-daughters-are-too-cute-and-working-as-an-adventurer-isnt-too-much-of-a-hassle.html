          <br/><br/>
          The noble class that treats those born with white hair or heterochromia as treacherous snakes, Shirley was born into the family of the most powerful duke in the land adorned with stunning hair the colour of snow, and non-matching red and blue eyes.
<br/><br/>
Hated by her own family, and having the only man who she ever loved snatched away by a jealous younger sister on her wedding night, she is imprisoned on false charges.
<br/><br/>
Enduring torture and humiliation, she vowed to take revenge against those who wronged her. But, even though she escaped, in her belly there was the child of her former fiancée.
<br/><br/>
Even if the man himself is hateful, an unborn child is without sin. After giving birth to healthy twins, she thought to leave them at an orphanage for safekeeping, but…
<br/><br/>
“Ah, what to do, my daughters are just too cute.”
<br/><br/>
Shirley was floored by the feelings she held for the two girls she had brought into the world. Choosing motherhood over revenge, she fled the Empire and settled in a remote town in the neighbouring Kingdom. In order to support her children, she found herself entering through the doors of the Adventurers Guild. It would be nice if they could live a nice quiet life out here, where the empire won’t think to look for them…
<br/><br/>
“Miss Shirley! Calamity-class monsters are appearing in the Kingdom! Can you help us!?”
<br/><br/>
“I’m very sorry, but I have to decline. I’m helping my daughters with their homework today.”
<br/><br/>
After ten years, she had somehow become known around the world over as “The Demonic White Sword”.
