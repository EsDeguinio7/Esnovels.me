<br/><br/>
With her black-and-white skirt fluttering in the wind, a girl declares her vow. Her name is Melody.
<br/><br/>
The girl, a reincarnator of Japanese origin, inherited the dream of her past life and began working as the maid of a ruined count household in the Kingdom of Theolas
<br/><br/>
She can transform cheap black tea into a top-shelf drink as easily as she can quickly upgrade a ruined estate into a newly-finished mansion.
<br/><br/>
From household cleaning to serving meals, hunting game to DIY construction, just leave everything to me! Anything’s possibile with the help of all-powerful magic!
<br/><br/>
Truthfully, this is actually the world of an otome game, and the superpowered, omnipotent Melody is actually the Saint… except she hasn’t realized it yet.
<br/><br/>
“Falling in love? Fighting the Demon Lord? More importantly, I’ve got chores to do!”
<br/><br/>
What will happen to a world whose savior has put her all into being a maid? How does the world cope when its grand script is discarded in favor of menial labor?
<br/><br/>
Welcome to a fantasy where a single job has upended the cogs of destiny!
