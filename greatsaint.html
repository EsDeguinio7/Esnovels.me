            𝚂𝚢𝚙𝚗𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚜:Hirune Hanamaki, who works for a black company with almost zero sleep, reincarnated in a different world with the blessing of a goddess because of her pure heart. Thanks to the blessing, her amount of magic power is strangely large, and her holy magic is extremely versatile. Eh, no one uses it like this?
<br/><br/>
“You have the talent of a saint.”
<br/><br/>
Hirune, who just wants to sleep on a fluffy futon, tries to skip work by making full use of holy magic, but the evaluation of the people around her continues to rise.
<br/><br/>
This means I’ll be working as hard as I did in my previous life. This is bad. Very bad. I’m also sleepy. Apparently, it is rumored that if you become a great saint, you’ll get your own church and you can live freely.
<br/><br/>
“Become a great saint and hang out on a futon all day long.”
<br/><br/>
She works hard for a leisurely life and becomes a great saint … Isn’t this pretty busy? I feel like I’m being worshiped a lot … It shouldn’t be like this …
<br/><br/>
This is the story of a dozing great saint who became a legend as she enjoyed a slow life at her own pace.
