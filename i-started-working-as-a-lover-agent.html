<br/><br/>
It’s sad and frustrating.
<br/><br/>
Ryoma Shiba, a University student who lacks money, searches for a part-time job with a high hourly wage. On the other hand, Himeno Kashiwagi is a girl who proclaims she has no interest in love but wants a boyfriend.
<br/><br/>
At the same time, they both hear about “Lover agent” from their friends and immediately register, unexpectedly scheduling a date with each other.
<br/><br/>
On the day of their first meeting, they were both nervous, but despite that, they held hands and drank tapioca, passing the time as a couple would.
<br/><br/>
In the midst of this, Himeno’s friend discovers them, and the situation gets awkward. When Himeno had trouble explaining, Ryoma lies, saying they were “dating”.
<br/><br/>
Ryoma acts as a real boyfriend, making Himeno’s heart pound…
<br/><br/>
This is a real love story that begins with a rental relationship.
