            𝚂𝚢𝚙𝚗𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚜:One day, Yuzuru Takasegawa — a first-year high school student — is urged by his grandfather to go on an arranged marriage meeting, insisting that he wants to see his great-grandson before he dies.
<br/><br/>
However, not wanting to bear the weight of a fiancee at the tender age of a freshman in high school, Yuzuru tries to avoid the arranged marriage meeting by imposing an irrational condition that, “ If she is Blonde Haired, Blue Eyed, Fair Skinned etc., only then I will think about the marriage”.
<br/><br/>
But somehow, he finds the girl who meets the conditions that Yuzuru has put out, and he reluctantly ends up going to matchmaking only once.
<br/><br/>
And on the day of matchmaking, it was Arisa Yukishiro, a beautiful girl with reputation at school, shows up on the scene.
<br/><br/>
Upon hearing her story, it seems she was also reluctantly made to go on matchmaking.
<br/><br/>
Therefore, the two of them try to prevent themselves from further marriage proposals with their false “engagement”.
<br/><br/>
And so, as they play the role of fake lovers, they find themselves in love with each other and become real lovers.
