            𝚂𝚢𝚙𝚗𝚘𝚜𝚒𝚜:Once upon a time, a boy was referred to as a “War Hero.”
<br/><br/>
In another world called Aletia, the boy who had saved the Lost Kingdom, conquered their neighbouring countries, and led to the rise of a grand empire decided to throw everything away, returning to the modern era at the cost of his memories.
<br/><br/>
As three years passed, the boy who was happily enjoying his daily life was once again called back to the other world.
<br/><br/>
However, what awaited him was the Aletia of 1000 years in the future.
<br/><br/>
As his past glories became a “myth,” the legend of the youth referred to as the, “Twin Black Hero King,” begins.
