A high school girl, Kanami Miria, reincarnated as the seventh daughter of an aristocrat.
<br/><br/>
Since she had lived a miserable life, she dreamed of living peacefully in her second life.
<br/><br/>
However, she reincarnated in a super-poor aristocratic family in the countryside.
<br/><br/>
The lord was a muscle-brain.
<br/><br/>
The lady was a pushover.
<br/><br/>
The eldest daughter was a depressed woman.
<br/><br/>
The second daughter was a hussy who divorced after she cheated on her husband.
<br/><br/>
The son-in-law was a lolicon.
<br/><br/>
Moreover, she was forced to become engaged to a poor merchant.
<br/><br/>
The situation was even worse than her previous life.
<br/><br/>
「I swear I will get out of this house and live a peaceful life!」
<br/><br/>
In order to achieve her goal, she practiced magic and secretly went to the Royal Girls Academy.
<br/><br/>
「Now my second life has begun! I’ll make friends with cute girls and have a yakiniku party!」
<br/><br/>
But, thanks to her omnipotent magical power, her evaluation became ridiculous.
<br/><br/>
「Giving me a title? I don’t need a title!」
<br/><br/>
「An audience with me? Please, no!」
<br/><br/>
The easygoing Miria decided to ignore them and aimed for a relaxing and peaceful life with her omnipotent magical power.
